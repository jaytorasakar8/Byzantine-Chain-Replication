# replica 2 drops completed_checkpoint(0) and crashes on completed_checkpoint(0).
# consequently, during reconfig, quorum contains some replicas that have dropped
# history before checkpoints, and some replicas that have not.
# scott stoller, 2017-11-26

# EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

#clients 0 to 4 each send one request.  clients 0,1 also send a second request.
#head sleeps briefly upon receiving requests from clients 0,1.  this ensures that
#other replicas have time to send their request 0 before client 0 or 1 sends
#its request 1.  thus, request 0 from every client is processed by head
#before request 1 from any client.  furthermore, checkpoint activity triggered by
#request 0 from any client completes before processing of request 1 from any client.

#config0 processes request 0 from at least 4 clients and sends result.
#head initiates two checkpoints.
#replica 2 drops completed_checkpoint(0) and crashes on completed_checkpoint(1).
#the crash leads to reconfiguration.
#tail drops wedge_request.  thus, quorum must contain replicas 0,1 (which have
#not dropped any prefix of their history) and replica 3 (which has dropped history
#before checkpoint 2).
#olympus may send results for some requests; exactly which may depend on timing.
#config1 should send results for remaining requests.  clients eventually receive
#results for all requests.
