# system takes two checkpoints.  
# system reconfigures after replica 3 drops shuttle.
# head performs extra_op before reconfig and is not included in quorum.
# scott stoller, 2017-11-26

# NOTATION
# request rij: j'th request expected to be successfully processed by config i

# EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

#client sends requests r00,r01,r02,r03,r04 to config0 and receives results.
#system should checkpoint after r01 and after r03.
#client sends request r05 to config0.
#head performs extra_op.  replica 3 drops shuttle for r05.
#system reconfigures. 
#successful quorum for reconfig must not contain head, because of extra_op.
#(this might not be detected until after catch_up and get_running_state.)
#quorum must contain replica 3 or 4 (or both).  olympus sends catch-up
#message containing r05 to whichever of them are in the quorum.
#olympus sends result for r05 (because majority of replicas correctly processed it).

#client sends r20 and r21 to config1 and receives results.
